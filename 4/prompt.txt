 I am providing a JavaScript function named `processUserData` and I want you to review it from three distinct expert perspectives - 
 an Experienced Developer,  a Security Engineer,  a Performance Specialist. 

Here is the function:  
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}

Analyze this code snippet from the following three perspectives:

1. Experienced Developer:
- Focus on code clarity, maintainability, idiomatic usage of the language, and clean design.
- Suggest improvements or refactors that enhance readability or code quality.

2. Security Engineer:
- Identify any potential vulnerabilities in the code (e.g., unsafe input handling, insecure logging).
- Suggest how to make the code more secure and robust against common threats.

3. Performance Specialist:
- Evaluate the codeâ€™s efficiency and memory usage.
- Suggest optimizations to improve runtime performance and scalability.

For each role list your observations and then provide specific and actionable recommendations for improvement.
