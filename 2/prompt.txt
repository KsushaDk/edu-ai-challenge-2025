You are helping developers convert informal bug notes into clear, well-structured bug reports. Given a short and vague bug note, rewrite it into a well-formatted bug report using the structure below:  
Title - a clear, concise summary of the issue.  
Description - a detailed description of the problem including what the user was trying to do when the issue occurred.   
Steps to Reproduce - a step-by-step list of actions someone can follow to reproduce the issue.
Expected vs Actual Behavior - explain what the user expected to happen and what actually happened instead.
Environment (if known) - list relevant environment details like browser, OS, device, etc. 
Severity or Impact - describe how this bug affects users or the system. Is it a blocker, critical, minor, etc.  
Example of informal bug note: “Logout button doesn’t work on Safari. It just doesn’t respond.”  
Now process this input using the format above.
